SBS: Strategic Balanced Scorecare

- Financial perspective examples: sales, income, earnings, profit, margins, investment, resources.
- External perspective: examples: customers, partners, vendors, regulators, job seekers, general public.
- Internal perspective: examples: processes, practices, governance, productivity, throughput.
